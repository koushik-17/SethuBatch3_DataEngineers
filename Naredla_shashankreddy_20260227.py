Write  a  program  to  determine  bill  amount  and  input  is  units

Units                                                      Cost
------------------------------------------------------------
First  100  units(0 - 99)					Rs. 3.00 / unit

Next  100  units(100 - 199)				Rs. 3.50 / unit

Next  200  units(200 - 399)		    	Rs. 4.00 / unit

Next  300  units(400 - 699)				Rs. 4.50 / unit

Above  700  units(units >= 700)		Rs. 5.00 / unit
---------------------------------------------------------------
Let  units  be  1200
What  is  the  bill  amount ? --->  100 * 3.00 + 100 * 3.50 + 200 * 4.00 +  300 * 4.50 + 500 * 5.00

Hint:  Use  match  ...  case   but  not  if ... else
